= FireGestures Script

The [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firegestures/|FireGestures]] extension for Firefox beside the built-in scripts can also run scripts written by the
user. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the [[http://xuldev.org/firegestures/getscripts.php|extension's home page script collection]].

Here are some scripts I wrote.

If the gesture was performed on an {{{a}}} element, the link will point to its {{{href}}}, otherwise to the current document.
If there is selected text, that will be the link text, otherwise the link {{{text}}} or the document {{{title}}} respectively.
