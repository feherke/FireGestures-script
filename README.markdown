# FireGestures Script

The [FireGestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firegestures/) extension for Firefox beside the built-in scripts can also run scripts written by the user. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the [extension's home page script collection](http://xuldev.org/firegestures/getscripts.php). Here are some scripts I wrote :

* [Popup,Hybrid] Copy URL and Title - Displays a list of formats and copies a link to the clipboard. If the gesture was performed on an `a` element, the link will point to its `href`, otherwise to the current document. If there is selected text, that will be the link text, otherwise the link text or the document title.
